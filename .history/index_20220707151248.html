                        At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Toyota is demo’ing it’s idea of the “Future of Mobility”.  As has become plainly obvious over the last couple years, Toyota believes plug-in vehicles will fail and that fuel cell EV’s are the future.  While other companies are at CES showing off battery based EV’s, Toyota is sticking with their fuel cells.

                        Its minimal yet artful interior is designed to help support its user experience. Lines flow from the center of the dashboard throughout the vehicle, while Yui travels around them, using light, sound and even touch to communicate critical information. It utilizes a single wide-screen, 3-D, full-color Head-Up Display that blends into an interior that is clean and uncluttered.

                        In the future, we envision you, Yui and the car working together—like teammates. Now, here comes the really fun part. Thanks to the car's advanced automated driving technologies, people with all levels of ability can enjoy the ride. You're still in charge of the car. However, through biometric sensors throughout the car, Concept-i can detect what you're feeling. That information then gets analyzed by the car's AI. That's when the automated features kick in.
